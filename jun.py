    This Streamlit application serves as a deployment interface for a pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`).

    **Functionality:**
    - **Load Model:** Attempts to load `model.pkl` from the application's root directory.
    - **Prediction Interface:** Provides input fields for the model's features and displays the prediction.
    - **Multi-Page Structure:** Uses a sidebar for navigation between different sections of the app.

    **To Customize This Template:**
    1.  Place your `model.pkl` file in the same directory as this `app.py` script.
    2.  **Crucially, update the global variables at the top of `app.py`:**
        *   `EXPECTED_NUM_FEATURES`: Set this to the number of input features your model requires.
        *   `FEATURE_NAMES` (optional but recommended): A list of names for your input features. This will make the UI more user-friendly.
        *   `CLASS_NAMES` (optional, for classification): If your model is a classifier, provide a list of your class labels in the correct order. This helps in displaying probabilities.
    3.  Adjust the input widgets (e.g., `st.number_input`, `st.slider`) in the `predict_page()` function to best suit your feature types (numerical, categorical, etc.) and their expected ranges.
    4.  Modify how the `prediction` and `probabilities` are displayed if needed.
